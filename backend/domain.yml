  utter_intro_smartgoals:
  - text: Research shows that doing things that give us a sense of accomplishment helps us feel better about ourselves. These are usually things we care about, skills we want to learn, or hobbies we enjoy, and we want to get better at. These should challenge us at least a little bit so we can make progress over time but still should be possible. One way we can improve in these things is to set small goals for ourselves.

  utter_setgoal3:
  - text : Turning a broad goal into a SMART goal usually requires breaking it down into smaller steps that reflect the characteristics of a SMART goal.
  utter_setgoal4:
  - text : Let‚Äôs start with "specific". Read your goal and check, Is it specific? That means have you defined in a way that it is only one goal, is clear and not ambiguous to you? 
  utter_setgoal5:
  - text : For example, if I had a broad goal to strengthen my cooking skills.
           A SMART goal would to be ‚Äúattempt three new dinner recipes from my favorite cookbook this week‚Äù.

           i. What I need to do (try three new recipes)
